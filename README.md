Hey guys !

Here's my front-end training, based on an idea from a developer friend: identify canvas and designs (we mostly focus on App's layouts here, but this doesn't have to be restrictive), then trying to reproduce them and document struggling, new stuff learned and solutions found. If appropriated, parts of the back-end may also be focused, but we focus motsly on front-end stuff to gain in ease with coding Views.

Neko.
