Hey guys !

Here's my front-end training, based on an idea from a developer friend: identify canvas and designs (we mostly focus on App's layouts here, but this doesn't have to be restrictive), then trying to reproduce them and document struggling, new stuff learned and solutions found. 

If appropriated and fitting some skills learning needs, we may also enter some specific parts of the back-end to train, so this may also be considered, but we focus mostly on front-end stuff to gain in ease with coding Views here.

Feel free to write feedbacks, this will definitely help me to improve my skills and become a better developer, I'm just a fresher for now ^^

Thanks for reading,

Neko
